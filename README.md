Clustering and Classification:
This code processes and classifies leaf images using OpenCV and Scikit-learn. It includes functions for operations like color space conversion, edge detection, and feature extraction (HOG and Hu moments). Images are read from a directory, processed, and organized into NumPy arrays. Various machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, are trained and evaluated for accuracy, identifying the best-performing model for classifying leaf images.
ML+machineVision:
The code analyzes a leaf dataset by loading and preprocessing the data, removing outliers, and normalizing features. It applies the KMeans algorithm for clustering and trains various machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, KNN) for classification. The accuracy of each model is evaluated, and the best model is identified. A voting method combines predictions from multiple models, while K-fold cross-validation assesses performance. Finally, a confusion matrix compares true labels with predicted labels to visualize results.
